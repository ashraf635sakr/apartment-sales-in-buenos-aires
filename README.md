## Project Description

This project aims to demonstrate data analysis and visualization techniques, including loading multiple CSV files into a pandas DataFrame, cleaning messy data, building a machine learning pipeline, and creating various visualizations to gain insights from the data.

## Folder Structure

Your project has the following folder structure:

- `data/`: Contains raw data files.
- `images/`: Contains visualization images.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for various labs.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will find:

-  Load multiple CSV files into a pandas DataFrame.
-  Clean messy data with a wrangle function.
-  Create a machine learning pipeline with feature encoding and imputation.
-  Create insightful visualizations, including a Mapbox scatter plot, a heatmap, and a bar chart for model coefficients.

## Instructions

To run the Jupyter notebooks in this project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder.
3. Open each notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the instructions and code within each notebook to complete the tasks.

## Usage

You can use this project to learn and practice data analysis and visualization techniques. Explore the provided Jupyter notebooks to understand how to load and clean data, build machine learning pipelines, and create insightful visualizations.
